# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Purpose
SQL was utilized to create databases that would help Pewlett Hackard prepare for the future as employees begin to near retirement. The databases would provide a list of employees who would be nearing retirement and qualify for a retirement package as well as provide a list of employees to possibly fill the positions that would be left open following the retirement of an employee via a mentorship program.

## Results
Below are 4 major points observed from the performed analysis:
### 1.	Majority of retiring employees hold senior positions (i.e Senior Engineer)
### 2.	Filling in senior roles are top priority to ensure that everything will run smoothly after an employee retires
### 3.	There are drastically more employees retiring than there are employees who would be able to fill the open position, the company needs to ensure that employees filling the open positions will have a smooth transition and thorough training to fill in possible gaps with the disparity
### 4.	The mentorship program list excludes all employees not born within the year 1965, which means there could possibly be more employees eligible for the program



## Summary
